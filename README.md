-- STILL WORK IN PROGRESS --
This is an insight demonstration for a hypothetical food delivery company. We wanted to use open source data from the Office of National Statistics to determine which region or cities in the U.K. a food delivery company should enter first based primarily by the estimated market size and population density requirement.<br />
